# TODO
    # Refactoring
        # In train.py
            # Before the actual loop/code, write pseudo-code for the loop
            # Before running the model, first check if the log dir can be made
        # In trainer.py + trainer_machine.py
            # Split train and eval functions. Let eval() return the threshold_checkpoints
    # Features
        # I removed log/save_first_round_model. We wanna provide a separate eval.py maybe.
        # Save models at last checkpoint
        # Actually, let each subtype of trainer machine have their own save and load functions
            # Need to figure out when we want to call these save and load functions
            # e.g. number of discovered classes how to save and load
