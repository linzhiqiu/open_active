# TODO
    # Refactoring
        # In train.py
            # Before the actual loop/code, write pseudo-code for the loop
    # Features
        # Save models at last checkpoint
        # Actually, let each subtype of trainer machine have their own save and load functions
            # Need to figure out when we want to call these save and load functions
            # e.g. number of discovered classes how to save and load
